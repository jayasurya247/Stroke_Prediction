# Stroke_Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code for building and evaluating several machine-learning models to predict the likelihood of a stroke based on health data from patients. The dataset used includes various medical attributes such as gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease status, and more.

## Data Description
Kaggle Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:
- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension
- Heart disease
- Ever married
- Work type
- Residence type
- Average glucose level
- BMI
- Smoking status
- Stroke (Target Variable)
  
## Installation and Usage
To set up the project environment:
1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/jayasurya247/Stroke_Prediction.git
2. Run the Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
## Models Implemented
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**

## Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using both original and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) enhanced datasets to handle class imbalance.

## Results
The models' performance can be found in the notebooks, showcasing detailed classification reports and accuracy comparisons.
